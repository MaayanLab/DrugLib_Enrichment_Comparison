In this project, I compare the agreement of different drug target libraries with different drug perturbation signature libraries using enrichment analysis. The drug target libraries I look at are DrugBank, the Target Central Resource Database, Drug Repurposing Hub, the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb), and DrugCentral. The drug perturbation signature libraries I used are the CRowd Extracted Expression of Differential Signatures (CREEDS) and the LINCS L1000.

For drug target libraries whose samples have a small number of gene targets on average, I used protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases to expand their target lists. The PPI databases I used are hu.MAP, ARCHS4, and BioGRID.

*Note: LINCS L1000 benchmarking has not yet been implemented.*
